	<p>The keys have the following functions:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>| X |</dt>
		<dd>To change the mode of stereo vision. The default mode is a cross-view mode (by squinting). The mode in parallel vision (look in the wave background) can also be used with a headset of virtual reality.</dd>
		
		<dt>| Ctrl + mouse drag | Ctrl + move keys |</dt>
		<dd>In zoom stereo view mode, there may be an offset between the two views. The Ctrl key allows, with the click-drag of the mouse, or the move keys, to adjust them by limiting its displacement to only one of both views.</dd>
		
		<dt>| Z |</dt>
		<dd>To change the mode of the stereo view. The default mode is a global view mode, adapted to the size of the screen (zoom Fit).<br />
		Zoom mode displays one pixel per screen pixel (100% zoom).<br />
		Since the image is often larger than the screen, it is also possible to move in the stereo view by clicking and dragging with the mouse.<br />
		Note that the browser zoom can be combined with the mouse wheel or the Ctrl + and Ctrl − shortcuts.<br />
		Finally, in 100% zoom mode, the image can be very large, and therefore long to load in memory... patience.</dd>
		
		<dt>| + | − | &nbsp; | H | J | K | L | &nbsp; | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |</dt>
		<dd>To zoom and move in the stereo view with the keyboard plus, minus; or H,J,K,L move keys; or eight move keys from numeric keypad.</dd>
		
		<dt>| Ctrl + Home | Ctrl + ↖ | ← | → | Ctrl + ↘ | Ctrl + End |</dt>
		<dd>These four keyboard shortcuts allow to browse an album. This is Piwigo default behaviour.
		<br />NB: It is hence possible to browse an entire album, with some stereo views, using only the keyboard.</dd>
		
		<dt>| R |</dt>
		<dd>Reset to 100% zoom and central image position.</dd>
		
		<dt>| F |</dt>
		<dd>To get full screen display. <span title="Escape">Esc</span> key pressed rolls it back (see also back button on mobile devices).</dd>
		
		<dt>| W |</dt>
		<dd>To get full window display. <span title="Escape">Esc</span> key pressed rolls it back.</dd>
		
		<dt>| ? | F1 | Help |</dt>
		<dd>To get this help in the stereo view page.</dd>
