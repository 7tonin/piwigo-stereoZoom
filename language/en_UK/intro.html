<p><strong>stereoZoom:</strong> used to display a stereo image made of a pair of views, joined side by side. <br />
Especially zoom in and out inside, coherently in each of the views intended for each of our eyes, while maintaining the parallelism of the displacements.<br />
Move and zoom are strored for each picture in a cookie, in order to get back at the same place when coming back on the picture. Data are stored for 7 days.</p>
	
	<p>The configuration page allows you to define how to recognize the images to be displayed in stereo, and also the default view mode.</p>
	<p>The keys have the following functions:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>X</dt>
		<dd>To change the mode of stereo vision. The default mode is a cross-view mode (by squinting). The mode in parallel vision (look in the wave background) can also be used with a headset of virtual reality.</dd>
		
		<dt>Ctrl + mouse drag</dt>
		<dd>In zoom stereo view mode, there may be an offset between the two views. The Ctrl key allows, with the click-drag of the mouse, to adjust them by limiting its displacement to only one of both views.</dd>
		
		<dt>Z</dt>
		<dd>To change the mode of the stereo view. The default mode is a global view mode, adapted to the size of the screen (zoom Fit).<br />
		Zoom mode displays one pixel per screen pixel (100% zoom).<br />
		Since the image is often larger than the screen, it is also possible to move in the stereo view by clicking and dragging with the mouse.<br />
		Note that the browser zoom can be combined with the mouse wheel or the Ctrl + and Ctrl − shortcuts.<br />
		Finally, in 100% zoom mode, the image can be very large, and therefore long to load in memory ... patience.</dd>
		
		<dt>+, −, four arrows keys</dt>
		<dd>To zoom and move with the keyboard.</dd>
		
		<dt>Home, End, Page Up, Page Down, Ctrl+(Home | End | Page Up | Page Down)</dt>
		<dd>To navigate in image list, and also to get to thumbnail list.</dd>
		
		<dt>R</dt>
		<dd>Reset to 100% zoom and central image position.</dd>
		
		<dt>F</dt>
		<dd>To get full screen display. <span title="Escape">Esc</span> key pressed rolls it back (see also back button on mobile devices).</dd>
		
		<dt>W</dt>
		<dd>To get full window display. <span title="Escape">Esc</span> key pressed rolls it back.</dd>
