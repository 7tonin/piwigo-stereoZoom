<p><strong>stereoZoom:</strong> used to display a stereo image made of a pair of views, joined side by side. Especially zoom in and out inside, coherently in each of the views intended for each of our eyes, while maintaining the parallelism of the displacements.</p>
	<p>The keys have the following functions:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Z</dt>
		<dd>To change the mode of the stereo view. The default mode is a global view mode, adapted to the size of the screen (zoom Fit).<br />
		Zoom mode displays one pixel per screen pixel (100% zoom).<br />
		Since the image is often larger than the screen, it is also possible to move in the stereo view by clicking and dragging with the mouse.<br />
		Note that the browser zoom can be combined with the mouse wheel or the Ctrl + and Ctrl - shortcuts.<br />
		Finally, in 100% zoom mode, the image can be very large, and therefore long to load in memory ... patience.</dd>
		
		<dt>X</dt>
		<dd>To change the mode of stereo vision. The default mode is a cross-view mode (by squinting). The mode in parallel vision (look in the wave background) can also be used with a headset of virtual reality.</dd>
		
		<dt>F</dt>
		<dd>Pour se placer en plein écran. Les touche Échap, Esc ou le bouton de retour en arrière sur les mobiles, permettent de quitter le plein écran.</dd>
		
		<dt>Ctrl</dt>
		<dd>In zoom stereo view mode, there may be an offset between the two views. The Ctrl key allows, with the click-drag of the mouse, to adjust them by limiting the displacement to only one of the two views.</dd>

	<p>The configuration page allows you to define how to recognize the images to be displayed in stereo.</p>
